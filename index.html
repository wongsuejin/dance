<h1>Dance</h1>
<b>Dance has been a big part of my life, ever since Primary School when it was one of my CCAs. Since then, I have joined my school dance clubs without fail and tried many different genres, from traditional Chinese dance to street styles like hip-hop. Now, dance is more than just a school CCA to me, but a hobby that I enjoy pursuing even in my free time! Below are some of the genres that I have been exposed to throughout my years as a dancer.</b>

<h1>Genres</h1>
<h2><i>Traditional Chinese Dance</i></h2>
<p>Traditional Chinese Dance has huge cultural significance. Even within this genre, there are different variations because of its different origins from the different ethnic groups. Some famous forms of Traditional Chinese dance include fan dance and long sleeves dance. As suggested in their names, the former uses fans as props while the latter requires the dancers' costume to have long sleeves which adds to charm of the technique.</p>

<h2><i>Hip-hop</i></h2>
<p>Hip-hop has rich culture and a long history dating back to the late 1960s. As a dance genre, it started out incorporating aspects from other dances like swing and tap. Then, popping and locking was created and included in this genre. Now, it has evolved with the times to include many other street styles. Some basics of hip-hop include bounces and grooves which are two fundamental exercises that the dancers train to continue improving.</p>

<h2><i>Contemporary</i></h2>
<p>Just like many other genres, contemporary dance was born and developed by incorporating different elements from different style of dance. Some key characteristics of this genre include floorwork, weight changes and contract-release. This genre may appear to be abstract as compared to the previous two genres but it is part of getting the audience to appreciate the art form.</p>
