<h1>VJD Family</h1>
<b>This is a community in which I had one of my most memorable dance experiences. I was part of Victoria Junior College's Dance Club and that was when I was first exposed to a variety of genres. In my 2 years with the club, we had many performance opportunities and I formed strong bonds with my fellow dancers. Though training was tough, we encouraged and supported one another, and it was through these tough times that we grew as people and dancers.</b>

<h2><b>1. VJ Musicfest</b></h2>
<p>This was my first performance with a small group of dancers from VJD. In a group of 7, we self-choreographed a three minutes item to showcase to our friends as part of the talent show! It was an eye-opening experience having to choreograph an entire item by ourselves and mix the music together.</p><br>

<h2><b>2. Victorian Affair</b></h2>
<p>This was the first milestone for my batch of dancers. It was a larger scale performance and we used a total of 7 songs, with each song having a duration of about 1.5 minutes. We practised for a little less than a month after our promotional exams where trainings took place 3-4 times a week. It was tiring having to dance item after item, hence we constantly encouraged one another and fed off each other's energy to push on! It was extremely fun preparing for this performance because our bonds grew stronger and we spent a lot of time with one another.</p><br>

<h2><b>3. Open House</b></h2>
<p>Though a comparatively smaller project, it was my first time choreographing an entire item with a co-choreographer. The purpose of this event was to attract incoming students to join VJC and also VJD, hence we wanted to showcase our fun culture as well as our techniques! It was a short project and trainings took place over the December holidays, so everything went by really fast.</p>

<h1>Vivace: VJD Concert</h1>
<p><b>Finally, our journey was coming to an end as we prepared for the biggest project yet, our very own dance production. We planned and organised our very own dance concert, featuring dancers from our club as well as alumni who came back to perform with us. Most of us had 7-8 items each and this was the time when we pushed ourselves the hardest. We wanted to showcase as many genres as possible - Latin, Ballroom, Breaking, Contemporary, Street Jazz, Ballet etc. and our efforts really paid off when our tickets for both days were sold out! It was a bittersweet journey filled with blood, sweat and tears but we pesevered through and learnt to balance both dance trainings and academics.</b></p><br>
